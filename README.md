My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2018

All solutions are based off the `base.py` script found in root, into which I've put some generic functionality that I want in most to all of the challanges (like reading the input file).

Code specific for the challange can usually be found in the `AdventOfCode.run()` function.

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
